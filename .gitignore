# ZIM content (if you ever generate temporary files within it)
# Generally, you want to keep your .zim files, so we don't ignore the directory.
# If you have specific temporary files generated inside zim-content, add them here.
# For example:
/zim-content/

# Web content (if you ever generate temporary files within it)
# Generally, you want to keep your web content.
# If you have specific temporary files generated inside web-content, add them here.
# For example:
# /web-content/**/*.bak

# LLM models (assuming these are large and might not be committed to Git)
# If you want to ignore the *contents* of llm-models but keep the directory, use:
/llm-models/*
!/llm-models/.gitkeep # Optional: keep the directory empty but tracked
# If you want to track the models, remove the above two lines.

# Generated resource files (e.g., for Windows icons)
